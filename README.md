SoapUI Plugin for Apigee
-------------------------------

Build with

mvn clean install

and drop the created jar in the SoapUI/bin/plugins folder. An "Add API from Apigee" action will show up on the Project
popup window allowing you to import one of the public APIs in the Apigee directory into SoapUI for adhoc testing, monitoring, etc.
